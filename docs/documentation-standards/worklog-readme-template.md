TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES (remove when using):

1. FRONTMATTER: Always include. Links this to phase sequence.

2. SEMANTIC NUMBERING: Preserve gaps if sections omitted.

3. NAMING CONVENTION:
   - Scripts: NN-descriptive-name.py
   - Outputs share prefix: 01-script.py → 01-output.log
   - Figures: NN-description.png

4. SECTIONS:
   - Summary: Always (the quick overview)
   - §1 Contents: Always (directory tree)
   - §2 Scripts: Always (what was built)
   - §3 Validation: Include if validation performed
   - §4 Figures: Include if figures produced
   - §5 Findings: Include if insights worth capturing
   - §6 Next Phase: Include if not final phase
   - §7 Provenance: Always (reproducibility)

5. INLINE FIGURES: Embed key figures with descriptions.
   Don't just list them—explain what they show.

6. KEEP IT LEAN: This documents work done, not work planned.
   Capture what matters for reproducibility and understanding.
